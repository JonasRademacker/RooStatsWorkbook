Key Concepts in Statistics
==========================

Basic Concepts

Physics Questions -> Statistical Tests -> Inference. 
Does the Higgs exist? Create test statistics, perform hypothesis testing, construct confidence intervals. Result. 

HEP workflow. 
Simulation (hard process + soft process -> detector)
Object Reconstruction
Event Selection
P(data|SM)

Statistical Model.
Given a measurement x (e.g. an event count) what is the probability to observe each possible value of x, under the hypothesis that the physics theory is true. 

Once you have a statistical model, all physics knowledge has been abstracted into the model and further steps in statistical inference are ‘procedural’ ie in principle no physics knowledge is required.

From Statistical Model To a Result
The next step of the analysis is to confront your model with the data and summarise the result in a probabilistic statement of some form. 
* Confidence interval
* p-value
* Measurement and variance estimate

Roadmap
=======
* Statistcal tests with simple hypotheses for counting data - probabilities 1: Probabilities
* Statistical test with simple hypothesis for distributions - p-values 2: Working with Distributions
* Hypothesis testing as a basis for event selection - optimal event selection and machine learning 3: Likelihood Principle
* Composite hypotheses (with parameters) for distributions - confidence intervals and maximum likelihood  4: Composite Hypothesis
* Statistical Inference with nuisance parameters - fitting the background 5: Nuisance Parameters and Systematics
* Response Functions and subsidiary measurements - sideband fits and systematic uncertainties. 6: Sidebands, Subsidaries, and Systematics
